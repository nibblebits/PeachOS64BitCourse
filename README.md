# PeachOS64 â€” Build a Modern 64-Bit Operating System From Scratch

This repository is the companion source code for **Part 2 of the PeachOS series**.  
In [Part 1](https://dragonzap.com/course/developing-a-multithreaded-kernel-from-scratch?coupon=GITHUBKERNELDISCOUNT), we built **PeachOS**, a fully functioning **32-bit multitasking operating system**.  

In **Part 2**, we take the project to the next level:  
ðŸš€ Building a **64-bit multi-threaded kernel** that runs in long mode with a **graphical user interface (GUI)** capable of rendering **interactive, clickable, draggable windows**.

## What Youâ€™ll Learn in This Course
This isnâ€™t just theoryâ€”youâ€™ll build a complete, modern OS step by step, starting from the bootloader all the way to a graphical desktop environment.

### ðŸ”¹ Module 1 Overview
- **Graphics & Display**
  - Capture and control the UEFI framebuffer (draw pixels directly to screen).
  - Load images & fonts.
  - Build a terminal that renders text using pixel-based fonts.
  - Create the graphical subsystem beneath the terminal:
    - Relative drawing anywhere on screen.  
    - Hierarchical graphics (parent/child offsets).  
    - Composable UI elements.

- **Memory Management**
  - Rebuild the heap allocator using the UEFI/BIOS E820 memory map.  
  - Multi-heap system with intelligent allocation.  
  - Paging-based **memory defragmenter** to solve fragmentation.

- **Disk & Partitions**
  - Extend FAT16 filesystem to support multiple **GPT partitions**.  
  - Mount each partition as a virtual drive.  
  - Abstract the disk system for modern SSD/PCIe storage support.

âœ… **By the end of Module 1, youâ€™ll have:**
- A 64-bit kernel bootable on modern UEFI hardware.  
- A pixel-based terminal with a full graphical foundation.  
- Advanced heap allocator + defragmentation support.  
- A multi-partition disk subsystem ready for GPT/SSD storage.

### ðŸ”® Coming in Module 2 (ETA: Dec 2025)
- Standard C library in userspace (`fopen`, `fread`, etc.) via `isr80h`.  
- Full **windowing system** with interactive GUI elements.  
- NVMe SSD driver (high-speed storage).  
- PCI/PCIe enumeration & bridge support.  
- Run **real user programs** on your OS â€” contribute to the shared GitHub repo of student applications!  

By the end of Part 2, youâ€™ll have built a **multi-threaded, 64-bit, GUI operating system** from scratchâ€”bootable on real hardware and extensible enough to run user applications.
